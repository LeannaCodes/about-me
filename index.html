        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <h3>Education</h3>

        <p>My name is Leanna Shannon Lucas. I was born in Romford in 1997. I was born 3 months early and almost didn't make it. 
            My education includes: 
            
            <ul>
                <li>Holly Trees Primary School</li>
                <li>Anglo European Language School</li>
                <li>Norwich University of Arts</li>
                <li>Code Fellows</li>

            </ul>I attented Holly Trees Primary School, Anglo European Language School and graduated with a Film and Moving Image 
            Production degree from Norwich University of Arts in 2019. I am currently a student with Tech Educators learning 
            how to code with Code Fellows. </p>

            <h3>Work Experience</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Lush Sales Assistant</li>
                <li>Lush Supervisor</li>
                <li>Community Associate IWG</li>
                <li>Project Manager</li>
            </ul>

            <p>My first job was in retail selling bath bombs and soaps delivering 5* customer service. I was then promoted to the
                management team where I worked as a supervisor for a year, managing a team of over 30 employees. I wanted to broaden 
                my knowledge in business so took a job with International Workplace Group managing a building of over 68 different 
                businesses. My next role was as an account manager building relationships with executive members of multiple companies 
                globally. Despite the range of roles I have worked in, my true passion is to pursue a career in tech as a software 
                developer.</p>
        
                <h3>My Goals</h3>

                <p>In 5 years time, I hope to have a job designing and coding websites and to also broaden my coding skills and languages.
                    I hope to never stop learning and to have lots of different skills and expertise under my belt, a jack of all trades!
                    I hope to be engaged to my partner and hope to have more animals. I would love to rescue more cats and maybe even a dog.</p>
